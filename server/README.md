# Parking Services

## Overview

Parking Services is a Django-based web application that provides a platform for managing parking reservations and vehicle information. This document guides you through the process of setting up and running the Parking Services server.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.6 or higher)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Django Ninja](https://django-ninja.rest-framework.com/)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parking-services.git
   cd parking-services
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run Migrations:**

   ```bash

9. **Change Superuser Role to Manager:**

   - In the Django admin interface, go to the "Users" section.
   - Find the superuser account you created and click on it.
   - In the "Role" section, change to the "Manager" role.
